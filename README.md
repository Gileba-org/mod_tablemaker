# TableMakerforCSV
Table maker for CSV: A module for creating HTML tables from CSV files.

This module has been renamed to "Tablemaker" so it can be added to the Joomla! Extension Directory. The new repository can be found 
 at https://github.com/Gileba-org/mod_tablemaker.

Note that you will need to create all modules again as there is no way to convert the tablemakerforcsv modules to a tablemaker module.
